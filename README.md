# Go-for-it

Welcome to **Go-for-it**! 🚀 This repository contains all my Go experiments as I explore the Go programming language. Each experiment is in its own folder.

## 📚 Learning Resource
I am following the tutorial:
[Go Programming Language Tutorial | Golang Tutorial For Beginners | Go Language Training](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q0sKAMal4WQ)
(as suggested by the Go Learn page).

## 🏰 Structure
Each experiment is in a separate folder with:
- `main.go` → The Go code for the experiment
- `README.md` → Explanation of the experiment

### Folder Structure:
```sh
go-for-it/
│── 001-hello-world/
│   ├── main.go
│── 002-variables-and-constants/
│   ├── main.go
│── README.md
```

## 🚀 Getting Started
### 1️⃣ Install Go
- [Download & Install Go](https://go.dev/doc/install)
- I am using **Go version 1.23.6**

### 2️⃣ Run an Experiment
```sh
cd 001-hello-world
go run main.go
```

## 📂 Experiments
| #   | Experiment Name          | Description                        |
|-----|--------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 001 | Hello World              | Basic "Hello, World!" in Go        |
| 002 | Variables & Constants    | Description of the next experiment |

_(More experiments will be added as I progress!)_

## 📌 Notes & Observations
- I'll document mistakes, best practices, and key takeaways.
- Feel free to suggest improvements or share tips!

Happy coding! 🐹🚀
